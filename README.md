# wallet_connect

## Run "flutter pub get" command first before run it to emulator
## in case you can't run it, I use FVM (Flutter Version Manager) stable version.

## Notes:
1. Pairing with URI from dApp (https://react-app.walletconnect.com/) is not working. Always invalid URI.
2. Biometric fingerprint is not working because of secret key from generated Android Key Store always null.

## Apologize Note:
First of all thank you for the opportunity to let me work on this assignment test. I need to learnmore (and I want to)
about dApp and Wallet or Web3 of how it works. So this is the best I can do so far right now using the official docs,
web-example project, and WalletConnectKotlinV2-1.0.0beta04 project. Once again, thank you very much. :)

P.S: maybe you guys can guide me about dApp, wallet, and web3 once I'm in? ;)
