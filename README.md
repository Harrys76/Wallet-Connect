# wallet_connect

## Run "flutter pub get" command first before run it to emulator
## in case you can't run it, I use FVM (Flutter Version Manager) stable version.

## Notes:
1. Pairing with URI from dApp (https://react-app.walletconnect.com/) is not working. Always invalid URI.
2. Biometric fingerprint is not working because of secret key from generated Android Key Store always null.
